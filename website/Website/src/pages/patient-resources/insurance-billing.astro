    Navigating insurance coverage for regenerative medicine can be complex. We're committed to helping you 
    understand your benefits and options while providing transparent billing practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Insurance Coverage Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Regenerative medicine is an evolving field, and insurance coverage varies significantly among providers and treatments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many regenerative medicine treatments are considered investigational or experimental</li>
    <li>Coverage depends on your specific insurance plan and the medical necessity of treatment</li>
    <li>Some treatments may be covered when used for FDA-approved indications</li>
    <li>Prior authorization is often required for potential coverage</li>
    <li>Out-of-pocket costs may apply even with insurance coverage</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Accepted Insurance Plans</h2>
  <p>We work with various insurance providers, though coverage for regenerative medicine varies:</p>
