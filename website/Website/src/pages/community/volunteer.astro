                  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What is the time commitment for volunteers?</h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-700">
                    We offer flexible volunteer opportunities ranging from 4 hours per week to 16+ hours per week. 
                    Most volunteers commit to a minimum of 6 months to ensure consistency for our patients and programs. 
                    We work with your schedule to find opportunities that fit your availability.

                  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Do I need medical experience to volunteer?</h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-700">
                    No medical experience is required! While healthcare experience is helpful for certain roles, 
                    we have many opportunities for volunteers from all backgrounds. We provide comprehensive training 
                    for all volunteer positions, and many of our most valued volunteers come from non-medical backgrounds.

                  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What does the background check process involve?</h3>
                  <p class="text-gray-700">
                    All volunteers undergo a standard background check and health screening for the safety of our patients 
                    and community. This includes criminal background verification and basic health clearance. 
                    The process typically takes 1-2 weeks and we'll guide you through each step.

                  <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Absolutely! Many of our volunteers have full-time jobs. We offer evening and weekend opportunities, 
                    and our community outreach events are often scheduled outside regular business hours. 
                    We're committed to working with your schedule to find meaningful ways for you to contribute.

                    All volunteers complete a 4-week training program that includes orientation, role-specific training, 
                    shadowing experienced volunteers, and HIPAA compliance education. Ongoing support and continuing 
                    education opportunities are provided throughout your volunteer experience.
